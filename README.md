# arduino-auto-light
Arduino Sketch for automated lightning (f.e. light-chain) with a movement-detector and photo-sensor

## what's this?
After uploading this sketch you have an automated light. 
The light is on, when it's dark and someone/something is moving around this light and is going off after a count of shinings (f.e. 5x20min).



## wiring
Wiring of your arduino board is easy and specified in the top of the sketch. You may easily change this.
Also some of the values should be changed to your wants.

Feel free to use this sketch for your own projects.
